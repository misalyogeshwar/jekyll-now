title: Hello World!

  Yes it is Hello WOrld! One more time.
  
  I dont understand the obsession with "Hello World". Maybe it gives the people ( read geeks) a slight feeling of new-ness and everything ( excitement, attention, focus etc. ) comes surrounding that. So beter than nothing!
  
  I am too starting new . Wish me luck !



Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
